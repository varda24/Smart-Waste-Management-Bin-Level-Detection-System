# 📌 Overview

The Smart Waste Management & Multi-Bin Monitoring System is an IoT-based solution designed to monitor waste bin levels and optimize waste collection operations.

The project simulates smart waste bins using ESP32 and HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor logic through Wokwi simulation and visualizes waste levels using a modern Streamlit dashboard.

The dashboard provides real-time monitoring of multiple bins, collection alerts, status analytics, and fill-level visualization.

---

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional waste collection follows fixed schedules regardless of whether bins are full or empty.

This results in:

* Overflowing waste bins
* Unnecessary collection trips
* Increased fuel consumption
* Higher operational costs
* Poor resource utilization

This project provides a smart monitoring system that enables data-driven waste collection decisions.

* Smart Cities
* Municipal Corporations
* Airport Waste Management
* Railway Stations
* Shopping Malls
* Educational Campuses
* Corporate Parks
* Waste Collection Companies

# 📈 Bin Status Logic

| Fill Percentage | Status    |
| --------------- | --------- |
| 0 - 49%         | EMPTY     |
| 50 - 79%        | HALF FULL |
| 80 - 100%       | FULL      |

---

# 📊 Sample Dashboard Metrics

| Bin   | Fill Level | Status    |
| ----- | ---------- | --------- |
| Bin A | 35%        | EMPTY     |
| Bin B | 68%        | HALF FULL |
| Bin C | 92%        | FULL      |

# 🔔 Alert Logic

```text
EMPTY      → No Alert

HALF FULL  → Monitor

FULL       → Collection Required
```
